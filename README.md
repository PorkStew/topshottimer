## What is it?

TopShot Timer is a shooting timer that can be used for various shooting disciplines. 

The TopShot Timer application is aimed at those individuals that would like to monitor their shooting on a week to week, month to month or even year to year basis. 

The timer allows for users to choose one of 10 different shot timer beeps. These beeps have been uniquely selected and chosen to match various tones of the physical shot timers on the market. An excellent feature of this application is that the shooter can decide on the sensitivity of the shot timer, allowing for dry fire practise at home as well as live fire at the shooting range. There are 5 different sensitivities that the shooter can chose from depending on the environment they are practising in. The shot timer also allows for a start delay of their choice, alternatively they can opt for a random start delay.

Once the shooter shoots a string, the shooter can decide if they would like to view the split times within that string. This allows for the shooter to monitor draw times, magazine changes and split times between shots. An excellent feature of the application is that the shooter can save their string. Shooters can therefore reference back and see their improvement or deterioration over time.

Overall, the TopShot Timer application allows for accurate recordings of shooters practicing their drills and having record of current and previous strings shot on their profile. The application is suitable for any skill level of shooter and is great to ensure improvement in any aspect of their shooting career.
